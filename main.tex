    I cannot express enough thanks to Dr. Nawazish Ali Khan chairman department of physics, for giving me the opportunity to do research in National Center of Physics and providing invaluable guidance throughout this research.\\
        I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Shamona Fawad Qazi for her assistance through my whole duration of M.Phil. She helped me to put my ideas, well above the level of simplicity and into something concrete. I would like to acknowledge his assistance in reading and correcting this thesis.\\  
    I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to Dr.Wajid Ali Khan who give me the golden opportunity to do this work and also for his patience, kindness and wisdom he has given to me during the whole work. Dr. Wajid Ali Khan is the person who open my mind for the experimental high energy physics. His kind suggestions and words guided me through my whole analysis.\\
   Thanks to all the members in High Energy Physics group at the National
Center for Physics (NCP), especially Dr. Usman Ashraf, Muhammad Gul for their positive criticism and continuous support and encouragement through the early stages of chaos and confusion. Thanks to Dr. Ashfaq Ahmad, Dr. Irfan Ashgar, Dr. Mohammad Ahmed, Sharjeel Kashif, Sheikh Mansoor who helped me in completing this work.\\
The greatest thanks goes to my beloved parents who encouraged me when ever I faced difficulties. Finally, I am grateful to my wife and son. They are always the source of my happiness and encourage me when I am depressed. \\[2cm]

    \chapter*{Abstract}
    The cross sections of $Z$ and $W$ boson and their ratios are experimentally measured at the ATLAS and CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider~(LHC) in proton-proton collision at various center of mass energies. Theoretically predicted cross section of the $W$ and $Z$ boson production cross section in a proton-proton collision at $\sqrt{s}=13~TeV$ and $14~TeV$ are presented in this thesis.

The vector boson production cross section measurement at hadron collision provides a deep understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and electroweak (EW) processes. The production of $W$ and $Z$ bosons are best examples of hard scattering processes at Large Hadron Collider. Theoretical predictions in perturbative chromodynamics are available at next-to-next-to-leading order~(NNLO).

Theoretically predicted production cross section and cross section ratios of $W$ and $Z$ vector bosons are compared with the measured results at various center of mass energies. Kinematics of these vector bosons and corresponding leptons are also presented.
